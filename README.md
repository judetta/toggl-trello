# Toggl<>Trello
Connecting Toggl Track and Trello with APIs.

I use Trello to manage my workload for studies and I use Toggl Track to keep an eye on how much I spend time 
on each course. One _card_ in Trello equals one course which again equals one _project_ in Toggl Track. 
The main purpose of this small project is simply to learn Python and how to use APIs.

:point_right: _Please note that this is not a finished project (will it ever be?) and I'm building it gradually whenever I have time :)_

### Idea #1

_in progress_

Add time logged for a course in Toggl Track to a field on a Trello card to see spent time in the same place 
where everything else.


### Idea #2

_future development, maybe_

Add new courses from Trello automatically as new projects in Toggl Track.
