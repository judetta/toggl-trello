# Toggl<>Trello
Connecting Toggl Track and Trello with APIs.

I use Trello to manage my workload for studies and I use Toggl Track to keep an eye on how much I spend time 
on each course. One _card_ in Trello equals one course which again equals one _project_ in Toggl Track. 
The main purpose of this small project is simply to learn more Python and how to use APIs.

### Current features

:white_check_mark: Add time logged for a course in Toggl Track to a custom field on the corresponding Trello card 
to see spent time in the same place where everything else.


### Future ideas

:small_orange_diamond: Compare - do not update time spent values if the new value is the same as old. \
:small_orange_diamond: Adding new courses from Trello automatically as new projects in Toggl Track. \
:small_orange_diamond: Archiving of Toggl project when course card in Trello moved to Finished courses list
